            <h2>FCFS</h2>
            <p>First Come First Serve (FCFS) is a fundamental algorithm in disk scheduling, where the requests arriving first are served first without any prioritization. In the context of disk scheduling, FCFS works by servicing the disk requests in the order they are received. This means that the disk arm moves to the cylinder requested by the first job in the queue, then to the next, and so forth, until all requests are fulfilled. While FCFS is straightforward and easy to implement, it may not always be the most efficient method, especially in scenarios where there's a significant difference in seek times between requests or when there's a mix of high and low priority tasks.</p>

            <h2>SSTF</h2>
            <p>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) is a disk scheduling algorithm used in computer storage systems to optimize the movement of the disk arm and reduce seek time. The SSTF algorithm selects the request with the shortest seek time from the current head position, prioritizing proximity over other factors like request order or arrival time. By minimizing the seek time, SSTF aims to improve overall disk performance and reduce latency. However, while SSTF is efficient in reducing seek time and improving throughput, it may lead to starvation for requests located farther from the disk arm's current position. Despite this drawback, SSTF remains a widely used disk scheduling algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in certain scenarios.

            <h2>SCAN</h2>
            <p>SCAN operates by moving the disk arm in one direction across the disk surface, serving pending requests along the way until reaching the end, then reverses direction. This back-and-forth movement minimizes seek time and reduces the average response time for disk operations. SCAN ensures fairness by serving requests in a first-come-first-serve manner, thereby preventing starvation of certain requests. However, it may result in increased waiting time for requests located farthest from the current disk arm position, leading to potential performance issues in high-load scenarios.</p>

            <h2>C-SCAN</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional SCAN algorithms which only move in one direction across the disk, C-SCAN considers the circular nature of the disk and restricts movement to one direction, either towards the end or the beginning of the disk. When the head reaches the end of the disk, it immediately returns to the beginning without servicing any requests in between, thus forming a circular path. This approach minimizes the average seek time by ensuring that the majority of requests are serviced in a contiguous manner. C-SCAN is particularly beneficial in scenarios where most requests are concentrated towards one end of the disk, as it prevents excessive seeks to the opposite end, enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

            <h2>LOOK</h2>
            <p>LOOK Algorithm is similar to the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm except for the difference that the disk arm in spite of going to the end of the disk goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses its direction from there only. Thus it prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.</p>
